Getting Started
---------------

Ensure that you have the very latest code running, with all the tests passing, as described in the [README](./README.md).  Manually test the REST end points. You may need something like the [PostMan Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en).

Please read the high level vision of this project as described [here](./), and check out some of these resources on participating in an Agile Project:

* [Pivotal Labs Danny Burke on Agile Project](https://youtu.be/CFVGT98gebM)
* [Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE)

If you haven't already, we recommend you run a manual asynchronous vote in the [#async_voter channel](https://Silverkeytechnologies.slack.com/messages/ttc). See the [manual asynchronous vote instructions](./ASYNC_VOTING.md) on how to do that.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document for information on our project workflow, and getting assigned a story to work on.

Also checkout the [README](./README.MD) file for instructions on how to get setup with this project

If possible please read [RESTful Web APIs](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4) or get [this book]((http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028468.do)) to understand how the core of our system and technology used works!
